Ingredients for making sambar recipe:

¾ cup toor dal
1 – 2 tbsp tamarind or tamarind water
¼ cup coriander leaves chopped
1 tbsp sambar powder
¼ tsp turmeric (skip if your sambar powder already has turmeric in it)
1 medium sliced onions
1-2 drumsticks
2-3 ladies finger
1 medium tomato
1 green chili slit
1 tbsp ghee
½ tsp mustard seeds
1 tbsp curry leaves
½ tsp cumin
2 pinches asafoetida or hing
1 red chili broken

Directions to make sambar recipe:

Firstly, in a pressure cooker, add ½ cup of toor dal with 2 cups of water and pressure cook for 5 whistles.
Meanwhile, in a small bowl, take small-sized tamarind (lemon-sized) and soak in water.
Take a large Kadai and add tamarind water.
To that add 1 tsp of jaggery along with slit green chili, salt, and turmeric powder
Now add the chopped vegetables and mix well.
Once the pressure is released, take the boiled toor dal and mash it nicely and add to the vegetables.
Add 2 tsp of sambar powder
Mix all the ingredients nicely and bring it to boil.
Once the vegetables are boiled, prepare the tempering by heating mustard seeds, hing, curry leaves and red chilies in a pan.
Once the mustard seeds are spluttered, and the raw smell of the curry leaves and hing goes away, add the sambar to it.
Freshly prepared sambar is ready to serve with plain rice or idli/ dosa.
